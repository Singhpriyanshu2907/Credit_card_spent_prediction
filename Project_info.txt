Modules Needed for the Credit Card Spent Prediction Model:-
    1. Pandas
    2. Numpy
    3. Scikit-learn
    4. Matplotlib (Optional)
    5. seaborn
    6. warnings (For removing warnings)
    7. Logger (For Logging project related information & changes)
    8. Various Regressor Modules, Feature Selection Modules for Model Building & selection, Performimg various EDA , Feature Selection.
    9. Datetime
        
Data cleaning & Model Creation & Selection steps:-
    
    1. Imported all the data that has been provided by the source.
    2. created a Profile report using pamdas profilling
    3. created various functions for Nullvalue treatment, Outlier treatment, Model Evaluation function & Plotting functions for
       the purpose of automation
    4. Merged different dataset to create a Customer 360 file by performing various EDA & variavle reduction technique.
    5. Intiated Model building by using various Regressor technique and evaluated the model on the basis of MAE, MSE, RMSE, RMSPE.
    6. Each Model has been created with best parameters which were found using "Gridsearch CV".
    7. Best Model has been selected & Saved in a pickle file under "source" folder.
    8. Final predicted values of credit Card spent Prediction has Saved in a Excel file under "source" folder 
       under the name predicted_values.xlsx.
    9. Pandas profilling reports has been saved under "Reports Folder"
    10. Dataset used for model has been saved under "Data Folder"
    11. CC_spent_Prediction.ipynb(consists of code realted to EDA, Feature Selection,Model Building &
        Model Selection)
    12 Model Pickle file & Logger.py(which consists the code for Logging information or Messages 
       into "Log" folder under "Source" folder)
